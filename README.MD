# 🚀 MasterDnsVPN

MasterDnsVPN is a powerful, cross-platform DNS tunneling VPN written in Python. It enables secure and covert data transmission by encapsulating VPN traffic within DNS queries and responses, allowing users to bypass network restrictions and firewalls by leveraging DNS as a transport channel.

MasterDnsVPN provides both server and client components, featuring robust encryption, flexible domain management, resolver balancing, and automatic MTU optimization. It is designed for bypassing censorship, enabling secure communication in restricted networks, and supporting research or educational purposes. For alternative DNS tunneling solutions, consider Dnstt, SlipStream, Iodine, or DNSCat2.

# 🚧 UNDER DEVELOPMENT
⚠️ This project is currently under development and is not yet fully functional. It is not ready for use at this time.

# ℹ️ Project Status

### This project is no longer actively maintained. Development was paused due to the emergence of similar DNS tunneling solutions for censorship bypass. However, the codebase remains available as a reference or foundation for your own DNS tunneling VPN implementation.

#### **Note:** The code is incomplete and may require additional development to function as intended.

### For an alternative DNS tunneling project, see [SlipStream Rust Plus](https://github.com/Fox-Fig/slipstream-rust-plus).

## 🛠️ How It Works

```
┌────────────┐      DNS Queries     ┌────────────┐      ┌────────────┐
│  Client    │  <---------------->  │   Server   │ <--> │  Internet  │
│ (Python)   │    (Encapsulated)    │  (Python)  │      │   (DNS)    │
└────────────┘                      └────────────┘      └────────────┘
```

1. 🗝️ Client encodes and encrypts VPN data into DNS queries.
2. 🔓 Server decodes, decrypts, and forwards data to the internet.
3. 🔁 Replies are sent back via DNS responses.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. 🖥️ Server Setup
1. Copy and edit the config:
   ```bash
   cp server_config.py.simple server_config.py
   # Edit server_config.py as needed
   ```
2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

### 2. 💻 Client Setup
1. Copy and edit the config:
   ```bash
   cp client_config.py.simple client_config.py
   # Edit client_config.py as needed
   ```
2. Run the client:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

## 📝 Configuration Tips

- 🌍 **Domains:** Use your own domain(s) pointed to the server's IP for tunneling.
- 🔑 **Encryption:** Set the same encryption method and key on both client and server. The key is generated by the server on first run (see logs).
- ⚡ **Resolvers:** Use fast, reliable DNS resolvers for best performance.
- 📏 **MTU:** The client will test and recommend optimal MTU values for upload/download.
- 🚫 **Packet Loss:** Remove or comment out slow/losing resolvers in the client config.
